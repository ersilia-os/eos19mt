Title: Antibiotic classes prediction
Description: An automated classification of chemicals in the ChEBI ontology 
  based on a neuro-symbolic AI technique that harnesses the ontology itself to 
  create the learning system and enables the classification of coumpounds into 
  GARDP antibiotic classes.
